# <p align="center"> Hey! You made it to the next stage ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤© </p>

By finishing the beginner tasks, you have learned the very basics of web development! Going through your submissions on the community and seeing some wonderful works have been amazing. But there's more work to do... ðŸ‘€

In this amateur taskboard, we'll be creating more advanced HTML components, like basic HTML validation used in forms e.g login/register pages, as well as take a pinch of CSS.

You learn by asking questions, so feel free to do so in the community. There will always be developers of all experience levels and stack to help you out.

Buckle your seatbelts, this will be a fun ride ðŸ˜Š.
